# Description
This directory contains my 2-nd year final ML project.

The project consists of 3 main parts:
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Dimensionality reduction
3. Model training

The goal is to gain meaningful insights from the Vodafone Age Dataset and compare popular ML models' performance on prediction of target variable.
